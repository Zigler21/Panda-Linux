# Panda-Linux
Panada Linux is a linux distrobution, this distrobution is built from the ground up as it is not base off of any other distrobution.


 If I am being completly honest, I have no idea as to what I am doing. I have no skill in programing or even working with computers unlike Linus Torvalds.
 So if there are issues (there will be issues.) please let me know... 
 If there is something that you would like me to add, feel free make a pull request and I will look at them every Saturday & Sunday.
